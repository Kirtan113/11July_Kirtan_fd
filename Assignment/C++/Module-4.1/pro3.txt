What is the difference between OOP and POP? 
            
OOP:                                      
1.OOP-->Object Oriented Programming.
2.Bottom up approach in program design. 
3.Large programs are divided into classes and
  objects.
4.Adding of data and functions is easy.
5.We can use namespace directly.
  Ex: using namespace std;
6.Concepts like inheritance polymorphism,
  data encapsulation, abstraction, access
  specifiers are available and can be used
  easily.
7.Ex: C++, Java, C# etc....
            
POP:
1.POP-->Procedure Oriented Programming.
2.Top down approach in program design.
3.Large programs are divided into smaller
  programs known as functions.
4.Adding of data and functions is
  difficult.
5.We cannot declare namespace directly.
6.Concepts like inheritance,
  polymorphism, data encapsulation,
  abstraction, access specifiers are not
  available.
7.Ex: C, Fortran, pascal, etc.....
